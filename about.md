- Consultant software developer at **ThoughtWorks** London.
- MEng computer science graduate from **York University**.

- I most enjoy developing for embedded systems and mobile.
- I don't have any strong preference for particular languages or frameworks. I tend to find that I choose the one that 
feels right for the problem at hand. I'm not a *\[Insert programming language here\]* developer, I'm very 
much a **polyglot developer**.
- I have a strong preference for working closely with business folks and product owners, I would dislike to be in a 
development team that is very segregated from their stakeholders and customers.
- I prefer working as part of a cross functional team, and taking a **lean** approach to development.

- I **love coaching** and teaching people coding skills, and often volunteer at events in order to do so.
- I strongly believe that regardless of money, gender, race, or anything else, everyone has the right to learn. As 
such, I am always happy to teach those who are willing and am also **always happy to be taught**.
