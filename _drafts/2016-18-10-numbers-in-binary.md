I give you a number, let's say *43.544* and ask you to represent that number in binary code. **Stuck?** Then this article is for you.

Recap: What is binary?
======================

So binary means *two states*, normally 0 and 1. These two states can be represented using *bits*. A bit can be thought of as a binary digit, like a number that can only have two values.

`0` is a bit
`1` is a bit
`01` is two bits
`1100 1111` is 8 bits *also known as a byte*

Bits are like the alphabet for computers, and *binary code* is the notion that you can represent instructions and values using just bits.
