'You're Toast' is my entry for the [Ludum Dare](http://ludumdare.com) 32 game jam. The game was built within 48 
hours, and all assets, including graphics and sounds created in that time.

The theme for this game jam was *the unconventional weapon*. I decided to have jam on toast and brocolli as my 
weapons, used to fight a war between frying pans and a toaster.

I would have liked to have had more time to improve the path finding of the sprites, however, I was pretty happy with
 the style of the entry.
 
I also forget to make the game music until the last second, so ended up recording a simple tune on guitar. The other 
game sounds are actually me and my friends making silly noises.
