QuickTry is an augmented reality wardrobe, built using Unity and the Microsoft Kinect 2.0.

It works by identifing users as they move into the camera field, and mapping the joints of the user/s to bones of digital a clothing model, which is then overlayed on screen.

*As a real user moves the on screen model moves too.*

The application also approximates the distance of the body from the camera and the bodies height, allowing it to scale the clothing model with the user.
