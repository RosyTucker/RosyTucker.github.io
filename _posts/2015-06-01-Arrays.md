An **Array** is a data structure, in fact one of the simplest and most commonly used data structures.
If you've ever created a software application you've probably used one, but do you understand how it works?
This article aims to provide a more detailed insight into the implementation of the **Array**.

What?
==================

Arrays are often instantiated using something like this:

{% highlight java%}
Object[] objectArray = new Object[10]
{% endhighlight %}

This statement creates an array which can hold 10 elements, this actually means that *10 contiguous memory
locations* (basically a block of space) are allocated, these can then be indexed into and assigned to. Each memory
location in an array can hold a primitive value (such as a char or int) or hold a reference to an object (a pointer).

Space Complexity
------

Depending on the language there is sometimes a memory overhead in the allocation of the array itself,
but in general, the number of memory locations required is equal to the size of the array.
This means that arrays have a linear space complexity, **O(n)**, such that an array of **n** elements
will require **n** memory addresses.

Accessing Elements
------

In order to access the individual elements we can do something similar to the following:

{% highlight java %}
Object[] objectArray = new Object[10];
Object objectOne = objectArray[0]; //Object at the base memory address + 0
Object objectFive = objectArray[4]; //Object at the base memory address + 4
{% endhighlight %}

This snippet shows that we can lookup an item in an array in constant time **O(1)**, it all just boils down to 
addition. This means that we could have any number of items in our array and it would take the same amount of time to
get access a reference to any one of them.

Searching For an Element
==================
    
When searching though an array, if you can not be sure that the array is sorted, you have to loop though the elements
 one-by-one until you find the element you are looking for:
 
{% highlight java %}
Object[] objectArray = new Object[10];
for(int i = 0; i < objectArray.length : ++i) {
    if(objectArray[i] == theObjectWeAreLookingFor) {
        //do something
    }
}
{% endhighlight %}

This is a pretty simple algorithm which, in order to *guarantee* that the element we are looking for is found, 
needs to iterate through every object in the array. This means that for an array of size **n** we will need to 
iterate through the loop **n** time, making the time complexity of **O(n)**.

Algorithmic Time Complexity
------

It's worth mentioning that we may find the element we are looking for prematurely, meaning we could exit the loop early.
On average when looking for an element in an unsorted array you should find it in **n/2** iterations, so why is the 
time complexity not **O(n/2)**?
This is because when talking about algorithmic complexity we normally talk about the **worst case**, as this is the 
only value that we can reliably make guarantees about. We also normally only take the highest level polynomial in the
 equation, assuming that the lower 
orders will be insignificant in comparison. For example, if an algorithm has a time complexity of **n<sup>2</sup> + 
5n + 3** we would say it is *in the order* of **n<sup>2</sup>**, using the Big-Oh notation **O(n<sup>2</sup>)** for 
short.

Length
------

The length of an array is normally stored on creation, for example,
if we were to create an array of size **10** the memory allocated would look something like this:


![Array Length]({{site.url}}/images/posts/Array2.png){:class="article-image"}

When you call:
{% highlight java %}
array.length
{% endhighlight %}

You are merely obtaining the stored value, meaning getting the length of an array has a complexity of **O(1)**.

Summary
==================

To conclude, arrays are blocks of memory which hold values or references to objects. Items within an array can be accessed in
constant time, and searched for in linear time.
