For my final year project, I decided to create an iOS game designed to screen for *dyslexia* in children and young 
adults. The game aimed was to determine if a child was likely to have dyslexia, *without explicitly testing their 
literacy skills*, in the hope of making the process more accessible, and encourage engagement from the child.

This project required me to learn a variety of software engineering skills, as well as scientific methods.
