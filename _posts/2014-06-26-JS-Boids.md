JS-Boids is a JavaScript implementation of flocking boids, as described by [Craig Reynolds](http://www.red3d.com/cwr/boids/),
using the HTML 5 canvas. It can be seen in it's full glory on my [homepage]({{site.url}}).

This project was my first attempt at, what was then, modern Javascript. The Boids fly around attempting to flock 
with each other. The repulsion, orientation and attraction weightings can be adjusted to alter the behaviour of the 
flock.

I would have liked to get the flocking around the edges working properly, such that a boid moving between two edges 
would be considered part fo the flock on both sides, but time got away from me. I would also have liked to have the 
styling configurable via css.
