NoteMaker is a simple, advertisement-free, note taking application created for Android.
It was originally created as part of a 12 hour hackathon. It allows notes to be quickly made, edited, and deleted, 
without any of the cruft or privacy invasions that the majority of note making apps are shipped with.

It was created for Android 2.1, and thus became rather outdated. I recently (2015) re-made the application for 
Android 4 and above. I have kept both versions on the market as many of the users of the old application are still 
using it, and are on android versions lower than 4.
